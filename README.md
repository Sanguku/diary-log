I started a personal wallet project called Sanguku. Honestly I still don't know what stack I should use. But I'm thinking of Golang as backend and either Flutter/Kotlin for UI (I haven't learn both, so idk). For database I will use SQL for sure, maybe mariadb. I will try to implement basic CI/CD too. I'm inspired from [Mobills App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.gerenciadorfinanceiro.controller&hl=en&gl=US). I love the features but there are some bugs I couldn't tolerate and they won't fix it. So I want to make it like this **BUT BETTER**. I want to try TDD, but first I want to plan what feature I should have. Then I'm gonna design the database. And before I start to code I'm gonna draw the whole stack and learn how app work in mobile.
